To get a vehicle back up to speed, make the [Repair](#Repair) move.\n  * Companion assets have a **health meter**, which is reduced when you make the [Companion Takes a Hit](#Companion-Takes-a-Hit) move. Their health is increased through the [Heal](#Heal) move when you treat them or obtain treatmentâ€”or using the [Repair](#Repair) move for mechanical companions.\n  * Some assets have a unique condition meter for a specialized resource. For example, if you are a FIREBRAND, you have a fire meter and tap into that inner source to unleash destructive energies.\n\nTo track the value of a condition meter on an asset card, use a paperclip or token. Or you can set a six-sided die on top of the card and rotate it to show the current value. The value of a meter cannot exceed the maximum shown on the card.\n\nYou can learn more about assets starting on page 50."
