    "Name": "Face Danger",
    "Text": "**When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat**, envision your action and roll. If you act...\n\n  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge\n  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart\n  * With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron\n  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow\n  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits\n\nOn a **strong hit**, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, you succeed, but at a troublesome cost. Make a suffer move (-1).\n\nOn a **miss**, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. __Pay the Price__."

  {
    "Name": "Secure an Advantage",
    "Text": "**When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain leverage**, envision your action and roll. If you act...\n\n  * With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge\n  * With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart\n  * With strength, endurance, aggression: Roll +iron\n  * With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow\n  * With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits\n\nOn a **strong hit**, take both. On a **weak hit**, choose one.\n\n  * Take +2 momentum\n  * Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)\n\nOn a **miss**, you fail or your assumptions betray you. __Pay the Price__."

  {
    "Name": "Gather Information",
    "Text": "**When you search for clues, ask questions, analyze evidence, or do research**, roll +wits.\n\nOn a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, the information provides new insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **miss**, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. __Pay the Price__."

  {
    "Name": "Compel",
    "Text": "**When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer**, envision your approach. If you...\n\n  * Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart\n  * Threaten or incite: Roll +iron\n  * Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow\n\nOn a **strong hit**, they’ll do what you want or agree to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand or complication. Envision their counteroffer.\n\nOn a **miss**, they refuse or make a demand which costs you greatly. __Pay the Price__."

  {
    "Name": "Aid Your Ally",
    "Text": "**When you act in direct support of an ally**, envision how you aid them. Then, __Secure an Advantage__ or __Gain Ground__ to take action. If you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.\n\nIf you __Gain Ground__ and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On a **weak hit**, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot."

  {
    "Name": "Check Your Gear",
    "Text": "**When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or resource**, roll +supply.\n\nOn a **strong hit**, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, you have it, but must choose one.\n\n  * Your supply is diminished: __Sacrifice Resources__ (-1)\n  * It’s not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: __Lose Momentum__ (-2)\n\nOn a **miss**, you don’t have it and the situation grows more perilous. __Pay the Price__."
