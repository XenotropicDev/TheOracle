Perhaps they were weapons built for conquest in a ancient war, or mighty devices designed to explore new worlds.\n\nMost colossi are found inactive—frozen in icy wastes, overgrown within verdant jungles, entombed in the depths of fathomless seas. Their armored shell is resistant to time and harsh environments, and they are nearly as imposing and majestic as the day they were forged.\n\nRarely, a colossus awakens to carry out its inscrutable purpose. They stride across the landscape of alien worlds, shaking the ground with each massive footfall. These active colossi ignore our attempts at communication and bat away our ineffectual attacks—the technology that powers them is beyond our understanding.",

Their lustrous coloration changes to mimic their environment, and they often appear as simply a part of the landscape until an unwitting explorer happens across them.\n\nCrystallids are mineral hoarders. Their hidden burrows hold a cache of precious stones and valuable ores. For this reason, explorers and prospectors often attempt to track crystallids back to their nest. “The bigger the crystallid, the better the haul,” is a common saying among those audacious fortune hunters. But that potential motherlode is not taken without risk—crystallids are fierce protectors of their hoard.",

They are adaptable to most climates and terrain, have iron constitutions, and are prized for the versatile and valuable milk produced by their females. Aside from its nutritive properties, the milk can be processed in a number of ways to manufacture potent medicines and powerful narcotics.\n\nA herd of sicklehorn are often sent with groups attempting to found a new planetside settlement. With careful breeding, the settlers can produce enough meat and milk to sustain themselves and trade for needed supplies. But sicklehorn are range animals, and raiders and rustlers often target a vulnerable herd. The creatures—especially a matriarch—are a valuable commodity.",
      "Quest Starter": "A settlement's prized sicklehorn matriarch has been stolen, the herd is in disarray, and the settlers won't survive another year without her return. The theft is blamed on a rival settlement on the same planet, but raiders also plague this sector. How are you involved?",

      "Description": "The **session moves** fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before, during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and guided modes.\n\nUnlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.",

          "Description": "To generate a faction name, first roll or choose the name template. Then, follow the structure of the template to build the name from individual tables. If you’ve already set the faction type, picking from the tables (instead of rolling) will likely provide a more appropriate result. For example, “Silver Jackals” is a fitting name for a criminal organization. The “Empire of the Undying Suns” is a less apt name for that gang—unless their leader is prone to delusions of grandeur. In short, choosing a name will give you more control. Rolling might give you a result that doesn’t square with known aspects, but those contradictions may prove inspiring.\n\nAn alternative approach to generating a faction from scratch is to start with a random name. Then, consider what the name evokes and choose an appropriate faction type instead of rolling on those tables. For example, “Bloody Ravens” might suggest a mercenary guild, while the “Republic of the Radiant Servants” brings to mind a dominion built upon a religion, or one that idolizes a prophesied leader. If a result doesn’t inspire anything interesting, roll again or pick.",
