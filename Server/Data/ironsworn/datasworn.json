      "Description": "Companions are your NPC helpers. When you acquire a companion, give them a name and envision their appearance and personality. If they don’t have a starting ability, choose one. Upgrading a companion enables additional abilities.\n\nCompanions utilize a health track and may suffer harm as a result of one of your moves. When your companion takes damage, make the [Companion Endure Harm](Ironsworn/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Endure_Harm) move (page 94) to determine the outcome. See page 43 to learn more.",

      "Description": "*Ironsworn* characters are assumed to be skilled fighters. Even without a combat talent, you can wield weapons and perform combat moves (page 78). A combat talent reflects a particular area of expertise, and gives you additional options and bonuses.\n\nCombat talent assets typically require you to wield a specific weapon, as noted in the asset text. For example, if you are a **Shield-Bearer** and don’t have a shield at the ready, you can’t use the asset’s abilities.",

Rumors persist of primordials who dwell in the deepest parts of the Wilds, or high in the ranges of the Veiled Mountains, who are as tall as an ancient tree. Beyond, some suggest, in the Shattered Wastes, live primordials who tower into the clouds. Is the sound of distant thunder sometimes the footfalls of mountain-sized primordials who dwell beyond the edges of the known world?\n\nPrimordials are solitary beings and as unpredictable as the natural forces they personify. They might ignore you. They might lurk at a distance, as if observing you. Or, they might attack. They do not speak in any language we can understand. Some suggest they have no intelligence, and are merely a manifestation of the natural world, no different than a winter storm.\n\nHow do you kill an primordial? Most scoff at the idea.

They can reference these moves as they like, but they can also decide the outcome or direct the question back to you.\n\nThere are three key aspects of using the fate moves:\n  * **Instinct:** If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is obvious, interesting and dramatic, make it happen.\n  * **Randomness:** You can roll on random tables to generate a result or answer a question.\n  * **Inspiration:** You can use creative prompts, such as those included in the oracles chapter (page 165) to guide your story.",

What do you learn? You Ask the Oracle, using the Description and Detail tables. The oracle responds, “Bloodied Banishment.”\n\nInterpreting these keywords, you envision this settlement’s grim method of enacting justice. Anyone sentenced to death for a crime is taken to the ruins. There, under the fading light of the setting sun, they are bloodied by the quick slash of a ceremonial blade. Finally, they are chained to an altar within the central courtyard. The foul creatures who dwell in that place do the rest.",
